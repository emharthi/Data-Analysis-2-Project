this Project has 3 Tasks:

*Tasks:*

Task 1: Naive Bayes Classifier
Objective: Build a Naive Bayes classifier to predict a target variable.

Deliverables:
- Python code implementing the Naive Bayes classifier.
- A short report explaining your data processing steps, model choice, performance 
evaluation, and insights gained from the model

Task 2: Market Basket Analysis
Objective: Use association rule learning techniques to perform Market Basket Analysis.
Deliverables:
- Python code implementing Market Basket Analysis.
- A short report summarizing the rules discovered and their potential real-world 
applications.


Task 3: Text Analysis (Extra Model)
Objective: Build a Naive Bayes text classification model to categorize text data.
Deliverables:
- Python code implementing the Naive Bayes text classifier.
- A short report explaining the text preprocessing, model performance, and insights 
gained from the analysis.

*The project outcomes, including code and reports, will be
hosted on this Repositorie.*
